/**
    NFT Freeport V2 


  Create a new, unknown Ethereum address X which you control 
  Select a random number 'salt'
  Derive a hash digest D, where D = sha256(tokenAddress,tokenId,X,salt)

  Store an NFT in this contract, belonging to hash digest D 

  Withdraw the NFT at a later time from address X, specifying your 'salt' number 



  By doing so, while the token is inside of the freeport contract, it is impossible to know who the owner is but only the owner will be able to withdraw it at a later time.
  The owner of the token is revealed when the art is removed from the Freeport.
